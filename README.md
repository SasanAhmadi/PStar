# Practice your Canadian PStar aviation exam with a free open source web application!

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm about to start my journey t o get my PPL in Canada. One of the first things you need to do is to get your <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/publications/student-pilot-permit-private-pilot-licence-foreign-military-applicants-aviation-regulations-tp-11919">PStar</a>. This is like a simple regulation test much like what you need to pass to get your driving license. The resource provided from the TC (Transport Canada) is just a 200 question to practice and you will be taking an exam of 50 questions out of this pool. </p>

<p>So, I started searching for some resources to practice this and to measure my mark out preparing myself for the exam, and boom! There is no simple thing so you can take the test and measure your knowledge.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to create a simple app myself and make it available for free! So you can go to this address: <a href="https://sasanahmadi.github.io/PStar/">sasanahmadi.github.io/PStar</a> to practice your knowledge over all 200 questions. It is simple, and easy! </p>

<p>Also, you can contribute back by providing more functionalities. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm thinking of adding more features like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Link to resources for questions</li><li>Creating actual exam like with select 50 questions to mock the actual exam.</li><li>Create a landing page to describe what you are about to experience! </li></ol>
